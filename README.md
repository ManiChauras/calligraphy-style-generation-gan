# Calligraphy-style-generation-gan

## Hackathon Description
This hackathon submission focuses on building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new calligraphy styles for handwritten letters. The model is trained on a custom calligraphy dataset containing multiple writing styles such as bold, italic, and artistic variations.

---

## Problem Statement
- Handwritten calligraphy styles are limited to predefined patterns.
- Creating new calligraphy styles manually is time-consuming.
- There is a need for an AI-based system that can generate new calligraphy styles automatically.

---

## Objective
- Train a Generative AI model on a custom calligraphy dataset.
- Learn stylistic features of handwritten letters.
- Generate new calligraphy-style letters within the same category.
- Demonstrate the use of GANs for creative and artistic applications.

---

## Dataset Details
- Custom dataset of handwritten calligraphy letter images.
- Multiple styles available for each letter:
  - Bold
  - Italic
  - Artistic / decorative styles
- Dataset is preprocessed and augmented before training.

---

## Model Architecture
The project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consisting of two models:

### Generator
- Takes random noise as input.
- Generates synthetic calligraphy letter images.
- Learns stroke patterns, thickness, and style variations.

### Discriminator
- Takes real and generated images as input.
- Classifies images as real or fake.
- Helps the generator improve output quality.

---

## Training Process
- Real images are taken from the custom dataset.
- Fake images are generated by the Generator.
- The Discriminator learns to differentiate real vs generated images.
- The Generator learns to fool the Discriminator.
- Both models improve through adversarial training.

---

## Output
- Generated images represent new calligraphy-style handwritten letters.
- Outputs preserve artistic flow and stroke consistency.
- Generated styles are similar to training styles but not exact copies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
