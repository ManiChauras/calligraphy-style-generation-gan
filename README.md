# Calligraphy-style-generation-gan
This repository implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on a custom calligraphy dataset to generate new handwritten letter styles. The dataset contains multiple calligraphy variations such as bold, italic, and artistic writing styles.

The model learns visual patterns from existing calligraphy samples and generates new calligraphy-style letters that follow similar stroke structure and artistic flow. This project demonstrates the use of Generative AI for creative handwriting and font-style generation.
